\subsection{APT - Advanced Persistent threats}
An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a sophisticated cyber attack where an attacker establishes a long-term presence in a network, as shown in the image where multiple "Zombie Hosts" are controlled by agents and a Command \& Control (C\&C) server.

\textbf{APT by image exmaple}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{resources/02-apt-01.png}
\begin{itemize}
    \item APT attackers use a multi-stage approach:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
        \item Initial compromise through agents that infect systems
        \item Establishing persistence by creating zombie hosts (compromised computers)
        \item Setting up command and control infrastructure behind firewalls
        \item Moving laterally through the network to infect more systems
        \item Exfiltrating data or maintaining long-term access
    \end{itemize}

    \item The image demonstrates key APT components:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
        \item Agents: Initial malware that compromises systems
        \item Zombie Hosts: Infected computers under attacker control
        \item C\&C Server: Central server used by attackers to send commands and receive data
        \item Firewall bypass: Shows how APTs create sophisticated communication channels through security defenses
    \end{itemize}

    \item APTs are typically associated with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
        \item Nation-state actors or well-funded criminal groups
        \item Long-term strategic goals rather than quick financial gain
        \item Advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection
        \item Targeted attacks against specific organizations or industries
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{resources/02-apt-02.png}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Infection: The initial compromise of a system through various attack vectors like phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or malware delivery. This is where the attacker first gains entry into the target network.
	\item Persistence: Attackers establish a long-term foothold by installing backdoors, creating admin accounts, or modifying system configurations to ensure they maintain access even if the initial entry point is discovered and closed.
	\item Exfiltration: The first phase of data theft, where attackers identify and collect valuable information. They often stage this data in specific locations within the network for later extraction.
	\item Privilege Elevation: Attackers move laterally and vertically through the network, gaining higher-level access permissions and compromising additional systems. This might involve stealing admin credentials or exploiting local vulnerabilities.
	\item Exfiltration II: With elevated privileges, attackers can access and steal more sensitive data from previously inaccessible systems or databases.
	\item Increase Network Access: The final stage where attackers solidify their control over the network, potentially creating additional backdoors and expanding their reach to maintain long-term access for future operations.
\end{enumerate}

This attack chain shows how APTs are methodical, patient operations rather than quick smash-and-grab attacks, with each stage building upon the previous one to achieve deeper network penetration.

\textbf{RCE}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ability to trigger arbitrary code execution over a network.
    \item This is the holy grail an attacker wants on your system!
    
    \subsubsection*{How to get RCE?}
    \item Command Injection
    \item File Upload (Upload a PHP file to a webserver)
    \item SQL Injections can sometimes be used to get RCE
    \item Buffer Overflow (write own instructions into the process memory and execute it)
    
    \subsubsection*{Exploitation limitation}
    \item Often, an exploit can only execute one command at a time
    \item Shells can be used to interactively execute commands on the system
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
        \item There are multiple types of shells
        \item Web Shells

    	\item Protocol abuse (exploiting allowed traffic)
    	\item Software vulnerabilities (exploiting code flaws)
    	\item Supply chain compromises (poisoned dependencies)
    	\item Misconfiguration (improper access controls)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The red dotted lines show potential attack paths, while green solid lines represent legitimate traffic flow.

\textbf{Intranet Port/Service Hopping Attack}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Attack Path:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
		\item Initial entry through WAF on port 443 (HTTPS)
		\item Hop to application server using allowed port 8080
		\item Move to database server on port 1433 (SQL)
		\item Each hop uses legitimate, allowed ports
    \end{itemize}

	\item Attack Methods:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
		\item Exploit WAF bypass techniques

		\item Network segmentation
		\item Zero-trust architecture
		\item Regular audit of allowed ports
		\item Service-to-service authentication
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Each step abuses legitimate communication paths rather than trying to breach through blocked ports or firewalls directly.

\textbf{Exchange server on premise attack}
\begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{resources/02-exchange-server-on-prem-attack.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Key Components:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist

    \end{itemize}

	\item Historical Context:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
		\item The German text mentions this was a common but dangerous setup
		\item Companies had Exchange servers directly accessible from Internet
		\item Should never place internet-facing services directly in Intranet
		\item All internet-facing services should be in DMZ
    \end{itemize}

        \tightlist
		\item ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-26855)
		\item ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473)
		\item Exchange Server RCE vulnerabilities
		\item Direct path to Active Directory
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This setup represents a dangerous legacy configuration that bypasses proper network segmentation principles.

\textbf{Citrix attack scenario}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{resources/02-citrix-attack-scenario.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Infrastructure Components:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
		\item Citrix server in DMZ
		\item AD and Storage in internal network

        \tightlist
		\item Malware/Trojans targeting Citrix infrastructure
		\item Remote user's physical presence
		\item Direct attacks on Citrix DMZ server
		\item Potential lateral movement to internal resources
    \end{itemize}

	\item Security Considerations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
		\item The German text explains that companies using Citrix or similar remote desktop solutions are better protected against viruses/trojans
		\item Malware is contained within Citrix DMZ
		\item Physical user presence creates additional attack surface
		\item DMZ placement provides isolation
    \end{itemize}

	\item Notable Aspects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
		\item Separation between internet and internal network
		\item Controlled access through Citrix gateway
		\item User session isolation
		\item DMZ acts as security boundary
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This setup represents a more secure approach where remote access is mediated through a DMZ-based Citrix infrastructure, containing potential threats.

\textbf{Covert Channel Attack explanation:}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{resources/02-cover-channel-attack.png}
\end{center}

		\item Multiple protocol options for communication
		\item Progression through network segments
		\item Ability to reach critical infrastructure (SCADA)
    \end{itemize}

	\item Key Points from German text:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
		\item Discusses various connection paths from intranet to internet
		\item If any of these protocols work, malware can establish reverse shell or C2 connection
		\item Forms the basis for malware and many APT attacks
		\item Emphasizes need for cyber defense to detect such traffic patterns
    \end{itemize}

	\item Critical Aspects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
		\item Multiple covert channels for resilience
		\item Legitimate protocols abuse
		\item Hard-to-detect communication methods
		\item Defense needs to monitor all these protocols
		\item Long-term persistent access capability
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This represents sophisticated C2 infrastructure using multiple covert channels to maintain communication with compromised systems.
